# What Is a SPA?

- "A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or web site that fits on a single web page with the goal of providing a more fluid user experience similar to a desktop application." - Wikipedia
- Browser fetches executable code that makes asynchronous calls for actual data to be shown
- Data is visualized and/or manipulated and stored back on server asynchronously

# Technical Overview

- Initial page load fetches index HTML and JavaScript
- JavaScript fetches the actual data via AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML). Data is usually JSON (or XML)
- JavaScript renders the data on templates and binds event handlers for clicks, keyboard input etc.

# React

- JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Released by Facebook in 2013
- Provides only the V in MVC
- Emphasis on declarative UI, view is a function of the state
- One-way data binding
